Manually apply the ngeo application changes as shown in the `ngeo.diff` file.
You should apply the changes shown in the diff file on `CONST_create_template/<file>` on your project's `<file>`.
Some advice to be more efficient: if the changes on a file concern a file that you never customize, you can simply copy the new file from `CONST_create_template` (`cp CONST_create_template/<file> <file>`).You can furthermore add this file to the `unmanaged_files` section of the `project.yaml` file, to avoid its contents appearing in the diff file for the next upgrade.
Note that you can also apply them using: git apply --3way ngeo.diff
To continue, type:
./upgrade latest 10
